### Automated Data Collection Systems in Major League Baseball (MLB)

The history of data collection technologies in Major League Baseball (MLB) has evolved significantly, moving from PITCHf/x to Statcast, and most recently to the Hawk-Eye system. Here's a brief overview:

#### PITCHf/x
PITCHf/x was introduced in MLB in 2006. It used three cameras installed in each MLB stadium to 
track the velocity, movement, release point, and location of pitches. PITCHf/x marked a revolution in baseball analytics, allowing teams, analysts, and fans to study the game in unprecedented detail, particularly pitching.

#### Statcast
MLB introduced Statcast in all 30 parks in 2015. Statcast was a significant step up from PITCHf/x. 
It used radar and optical tracking (initially a combination of radar technology from TrackMan and 
optical technology from ChyronHego) to measure not just pitches but also player movements, 
batted ball statistics, and more. This system collected data on an enhnaced feature set 
from in-game play, including exit velocity, launch angle, and sprint speed, offering a 
comprehensive picture of both pitching and hitting, as well as fielding.

#### Hawk-Eye
Hawk-Eye was adopted by MLB starting in the 2020 season, representing a new technological leap in MLB sensing platforms.
Replacing Statcast's radar system, Hawk-Eye uses a series of high-resolution optical cameras 
around the stadium. It's more accurate in tracking the baseball and player movements.
Hawk-Eye provides improved accuracy and a wider array of data points. It can capture the spin 
rate of pitches, the stance and movements of players, and more intricate details of every play.
Evolutionary Significance
 
#### MLB Sensor Platform Evolution

With each technological iteration, the accuracy and detail of data collection in MLB have 
improved significantly. This data has transformed and continues to transform how players are 
evaluated and trained, how games are analyzed, and how fans understand the sport. Each system's 
introduction marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of baseball analytics, 
enabling and accelerting the sport's growing emphasis on data-driven decision-making and analytics.
